# Show-COVID-19-Data

A Python script that downloads COVID-19 data from the [JHU repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and visualizes them either country-wise or in groups of countries.

The script does use NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib (and and optionally an Excel-interface package, openpyxl or xlrd ...). It's currently running on an [Anaconda Python 3.7 distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
