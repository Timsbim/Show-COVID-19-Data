# Show-COVID-19-Data

A Python script that downloads COVID-19 data from the JHU repository (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and visualizes them either country-wise or in groups of countries.

The script does use NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib (and an Excel-interface package, I think openpyxl or xlrd ... :(). I'm running it with an Anaconda Python 3.7 distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). At the moment all major functions are decorated for measuring their execution time (with a rudimentary decorator that is also provided in https://github.com/Timsbim/Show-COVID-19-Data/blob/master/timing.py).

A heartfelt thanks to JetBrains for providing a free-to-use version of PyCharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), a wonderful IDE for Python development.
