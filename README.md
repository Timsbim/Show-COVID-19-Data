# Show-COVID-19-Data

A Python script that downloads COVID-19 data from the [JHU repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and visualizes them either country-wise or in groups of countries. On March 10, 2023, the repository has been archived and won't be updated any more.

The script does use NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib (and optionally the Excel-interface package openpyxl).
